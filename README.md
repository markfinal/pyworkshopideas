# Ideas for programming workshops

## The basics
To give everyone a chance to write a working program, whatever their skill, start with Hello world

* `helloworld.py`

and then extend that into looping forever

* `helloworld_forever.py`

### Extended basics
Once everyone has tried that out, briefly introduce
* variables
* math operations
* lists
* functions
  * built in, like asking for a number from the user
  * user defined

## Maths
### Factorials
Ask for a number n, calculate n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 1
* `factorial.py`

### Fibonacci
The sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, .... so the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers.
* `fibonacci.py`

You can see the computer start to slow quite quickly as the numbers grow bigger.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes
Finding prime numbers
* `sieve_of_eratosthenes.py`

### Secret ciphers
Read in a message, encrypt it and share the secret
* `secretmessage.py`

## Graphics
Use PyGame to draw shapes on screen
```
pip install pygame
```

### Draw a landscape
* `pygame_landscape.py`

### Draw a face
* `pygame_face.py`
